//lets play with var type of variable 

var sd=45
console.log(sd)
var sd=34
console.log(sd)
var sd="i am jyotirmay gupta what about you"
console.log(sd)
//the main thing about var is, we can redeclare it and we can also change it value as we go down in our code
//that is why in contempoary programming we dont prefer to use it we try to avoid its usage in our programming

//another variable of java script is let and we cannot redeclare it, but we can change its value as goes down in our writing code
// let ha=45
let ha ="jyotirmay gupta is here "
console.log(ha)
ha="ha ha i am enjoying learning java script and i am happy to learn it with code with harry "
 console.log(ha)

//another variable is constant variable 
//the main difference about this variable is, we cannot redeclare it and even we cannot change its value as we goes deep down in writing code
const pdf="balaji is a biggest ashhole in our room"
//pdf=3434  //it will show error

//we use this thing to know type of data 
let ggo=true
console.log(typeof sd)
